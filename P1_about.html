            <p>Kabir Café or Neeraj Arya's Kabir Café is an
                 Indian indie-folk and folk-fusion music band
                 based in Mumbai. Originated in 2013, it 
                 consists of Neeraj Arya, founder and Mukund 
                 Ramaswamy, co-founder of the band along with
                 other artists. Neeraj Arya, the founder of 
                 the group and a self-taught artist started 
                 his music career as a solo-artist in early 
            <img class="about-band-image" src="Images/Kabir_Cafe.jpg" width="300" height="350">
                 2000s. Influenced by his guru Prahlad Singh 
                 Tipaniya, Neeraj Arya was introduced to the 
                 15th century's saint Kabir and started playing 
                 folk melodies of Kabir's dohas and Samji's.
                 In 2012, performing on the streets of Mumbai 
                 as part of the non-profit organisation, Natural 
                 Streets for Performing Arts (NSPA), Arya met 
                 violinist Mukund Ramaswamy, who is a Carnatic 
                 Violinist, and the two started performing as 
                 a duo. The band members always refer to Saint 
                 Kabir as the first member because the songs 
                 are based on the teachings and philosophy of Kabir .</p>
            <p>By the time, more artists joined the group and 
                in late 2013 the group represented itself as 
                Kabir Café. The band has released three albums, 
                their debut 'Panchrang' in 2016; their second 
                live album 'Kabir Café Live' in 2018 and third 
                album 'SABR' in 2022. The band is empanelled with 
                ICCR. Since its formation, the band has performed 
                over 800 concerts across India and abroad. Till 2021, 
                they have performed in 11 countries. The Panchrang 
                song Mann Lagyo Mero Yaar Fakiri Mein was featured 
                in 2017 Indian comedy-drama film Hindi Medium as 'Fakiri'. 
                Hoshiyar Rehna Nagar Mein Chor Aavega was featured in the 
                film Baadshaho. Matkar Maya Ko Ahankar song from the same 
                album and Kya Leke Aaya Jagat Mein were featured in
